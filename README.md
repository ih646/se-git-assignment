# Software Engineering Git Assignment

## Here is my article:

[Our Hackable Political Future](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/opinion/hacking-politics-future.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&action=click&contentCollection=technology&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront)

The article brings up interesting points there is software available to manipulate video footage, and how this can introduce fake content onto the news cycle. I found this to be interesting because it brings up the issue of ethical software and forces software developers to think about how their software can be used to unethical reasons.

### Matthew Tessler:

> This article really brought it all into perspective. Optimistically, becauses of how ubiquitous fake photos and videos are becoming, I'm hoping that it will come to such an extreme that it's necessary to only believe information that can be sourced directly from an individual or organization. Maybe making it so easy to manipulate video will lead to greater verification of information. For instance, if there was a claim that someone said something, it could be verified by multiple trusted sources, kind of like with cryptography. If there was a chain of trust like with HTTPS in web browsers, maybe it could solve this information verification issue. That would do some good. 

#### Imtiaz Haque:  

>This article very clearly demonstrates the double edged nature of such a rapid advancement of technology in today's era.  
Indeed, the previous concept of a fake photo, where one can simply crop someone else's head on different bodies has been  
taken up by quite a few notches. It raises the issue of what constitutes as authentic information and to what degree technology  
like this should be regulated.
