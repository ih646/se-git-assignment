# Software Engineering Git Assignment

## Here is my article:

[Our Hackable Political Future](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/opinion/hacking-politics-future.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&action=click&contentCollection=technology&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront)

The article brings up interesting points there is software available to manipulate video footage, and how this can introduce fake content onto the news cycle. I found this to be interesting because it brings up the issue of ethical software and forces software developers to think about how their software can be used to unethical reasons.
